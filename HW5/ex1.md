- **Avoid Vague Statements:**
    - "Too Many if Statements" should specify examples or point to exact areas in the code where this is a problem.
    - "Loops Seem Inefficient" needs a clearer explanation of the inefficiency, like time complexity or specific scenarios where performance might degrade.

- **Professional Tone:**
    - The phrase "Basic Programming 101 knowledge ;)" is dismissive and unprofessional. Keep feedback constructive and neutral.

- **Focus on Actionable Feedback:**
    - Instead of "itâ€™s not clear why a try-catch block is used," suggest explicitly clarifying the exceptions being handled in the code with comments or documentation.

- **Evidence-Based Feedback:**
    - "There might be a security risk" is speculative. It's better to highlight a specific code area and why it might be vulnerable or request more context to verify concerns.

- **Provide Concrete Suggestions:**
    - Instead of saying "try to make it simpler," suggest specific refactoring techniques, such as introducing helper methods or reducing nesting.

- **Testing Suggestions:**
    - Simply stating "there could be more tests" is too vague. Identify specific test cases that might be missing, such as edge cases or scenarios related to input validation.

- **Focus on Specificity:**
    - "Add more comments" could point to specific parts of the code that are unclear or require better explanation.

- **Be Consistent:**
    - The reviewer praises the tests in one place but then says they are insufficient. Ensure feedback is aligned or clarify the scope of improvement.

- **Avoid Generalizations:**
    - Avoid statements like "the code could be more efficient" without identifying specific inefficiencies or suggesting optimizations.

- **Mention Positive Aspects Explicitly:**
    - Highlight specific strengths of the code to balance the critique and motivate the developer. For example, mention that the exception validation is a good safeguard.
